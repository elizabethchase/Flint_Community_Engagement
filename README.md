# Flint_Community_Engagement
This is the repository for all quantitative analyses for the Flint Community Engagement Project, a collaboration with Dr. Jerel Ezell. Unfortunately, the data needed to actually reproduce these analyses cannot be made publicly available at this time, but we provide the code for transparency. 

It includes R Markdown files to reproduce the analyses for:

1. Our paper on the adult health effects of the Flint Water Crisis: Ezell and Chase, "A Population Based Assessment of Physical Symptoms and Mental Health Outcomes Among Adults Following the Flint Water Crisis", Journal of Urban Health 2021 (paperone_adult_health.Rmd)

2. Our 2022 paper on the child health effects of the Flint Water Crisis (papertwo_child_health.Rmd)

3. Our 2022 paper on the political/attitude effects of the Flint Water Crisis (paperthree_politics.Rmd)

4. Our 2022 paper on health behavior uptake in the wake of the Flint Water Crisis (paperfour_healthbehaviors.Rmd)
