# Flint_Community_Engagement
This is the repository for all quantitative analyses for the Flint Community Engagement Project, a collaboration with Dr. Jerel Ezell. Unfortunately, the data needed to actually reproduce these analyses cannot be made publicly available at this time, but we provide the code for transparency. 

It includes R Markdown files to reproduce the analyses for:

1. Our 2021 paper on the adult health effects of the Flint Water Crisis (paperone_adult_health.Rmd)

2. Our 2021 paper on the child health effects of the Flint Water Crisis (papertwo_child_health.Rmd)

3. Our 2021 paper on the political/attitude effects of the Flint Water Crisis (paperthree_politics.Rmd)
