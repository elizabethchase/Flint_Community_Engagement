# Flint_Community_Engagement
This is the repository for all quantitative analyses for the Flint Community Engagement Project, a collaboration with Dr. Jerel Ezell. Unfortunately, the data needed to actually reproduce these analyses cannot be made publicly available at this time, but we provide the code for transparency. 

It includes R Markdown files to reproduce the analyses for:
